%% Work out the space occupied by the scene

%at, in other words, this is the space xyz that the intial voxel structure
%will be placed so it can be carved. Increasing this world we have a
%greater volume coverage but each voxel will be more spread which would
%result in a 3D model with less resolution.

%% Create a Voxel Array
% in this part, we create a voxel 3d mapping within those limits defined before.
% the forth argument indicates how many voxels there will be in each
% component xyz, thereby increasing this number reduces the spread between
% each voxel and increases the accuracy of the model. This comes at a cost
% of a increased run time and memory usage.
